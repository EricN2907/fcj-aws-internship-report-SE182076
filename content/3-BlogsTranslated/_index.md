###  [Blog 1 - Simplify your canary by batching multiple URLs in Amazon CloudWatch Synthetics](3.1-Blog1/)
This article guides you on how to optimize your monitoring process by batching multiple URLs into a single Canary in Amazon CloudWatch Synthetics. Instead of creating and paying for individual Canaries to monitor each endpoint, you can use the "Heartbeat monitoring" blueprint (using runtime syn-nodejs-puppeteer-3.1 or later) to check a series of URLs simultaneously. This solution allows you to view the status, response time, and screenshots of each URL in a consolidated report, while significantly reducing costs since CloudWatch Synthetics charges based on the number of Canary runs.
