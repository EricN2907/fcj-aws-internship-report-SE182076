# AWS completes Police-Assured Secure Facilities (PASF) audit in Europe (London) AWS Region

*by Vishal Pabari and Tea Jioshvili on 11 June 2025*

We’re excited to announce that our Europe (London) AWS Region has renewed its accreditation for United Kingdom (UK) Police-Assured Secure Facilities (PASF) for Official-Sensitive data. Since 2017, the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Europe (London) Region has been accredited under the PASF program. This demonstrates our continuous commitment to adhere to the heightened expectations of customers with UK law enforcement workloads. Our UK law enforcement customers who require PASF can continue to run their applications in the PASF-accredited Europe (London) Region in confidence.

The PASF is a long-established assurance process, used by UK law enforcement, as a method for assuring the security of facilities such as data centers or other locations that house critical business applications that process or hold police data. PASF consists of a control set of security requirements, an on-site inspection, and an audit interview with representatives of the facility.

The Police Digital Service (PDS) confirmed the accreditation renewal for AWS on May 27, 2025. A confirmation letter can be found on **AWS Artifact**. The UK police force and law enforcement organizations can also obtain confirmation of the compliance status of AWS through the **Police Digital Service**.

To learn more about our compliance and security programs, see **AWS Compliance Programs**. As always, we value your feedback and questions; reach out to the AWS Compliance team through the **Contact Us** page.

Reach out to your AWS account team if you have questions or feedback about PASF compliance.
