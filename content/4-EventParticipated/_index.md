The day’s activities featured high-level plenary sessions with government officials and industry leaders, followed by in-depth technical tracks focused on *Data Strategy*, *DevOps*, and *Cloud Migration Pathways*.

#### **Key Takeaways and Outcomes**  
- **Strategic Insights**: Gained a deeper understanding of the critical interplay between Generative AI and a robust data strategy, identified as the key driver for success in modern enterprises.  
- **Migration to Operate Mindset**: Developed an appreciation for the *"Migrate to Operate"* framework, which emphasizes using AI to streamline operations and optimize costs post-cloud migration.  
- **Technical Knowledge**: Acquired insights into the integration of Generative AI within the DevOps lifecycle, particularly in automating code generation and testing.
