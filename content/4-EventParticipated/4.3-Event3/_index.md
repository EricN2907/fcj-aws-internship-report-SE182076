# Summary Report: AWS Cloud Mastery Series #1 -- AI/ML/GenAI on AWS (Paraphrased)

## Event Objectives

-   Provide a clear overview of the AI/ML landscape in Vietnam and AWS's
    growing AI ecosystem.
-   Explain the full Machine Learning lifecycle using **Amazon
    SageMaker**, from data preparation to deployment.
-   Introduce Generative AI capabilities on **Amazon Bedrock**,
    including Foundation Models, RAG, and Agents.
-   Equip participants with practical prompt engineering methods and
    ways to build AI-powered applications without deep data science
    expertise.

## Time & Location

**Time:** 08:30 -- 12:00, Saturday, November 15, 2025\
**Location:** 26th Floor, Bitexco Financial Tower, 2 Hai Trieu Street,
Ben Nghe Ward, District 1, Ho Chi Minh City

## Speakers

-   **Dinh Le Hoang Anh** -- Cloud Engineer Trainee\
-   **Lam Tuan Kiet** -- Senior DevOps Engineer, FPT Software\
-   **Danh Hoang Hieu Nghi** -- AI Engineer, Renova Cloud

## Key Highlights

### 1. AWS AI/ML Overview (Amazon SageMaker)

-   SageMaker offers a complete ML pipeline: data wrangling, labeling,
    model training, deployment, and monitoring.
-   Emphasized the importance of MLOps for creating consistent and
    scalable ML workflows.
-   Live demonstration of SageMaker Studio, showcasing model building in
    an integrated environment.

### 2. Generative AI with Amazon Bedrock

-   Bedrock provides serverless access to top-tier Foundation Models
    through a unified API.
-   Guidance on selecting suitable models based on workload,
    performance, and reasoning needs.
-   Explanation of the RAG architecture and how it enhances model
    accuracy by grounding outputs in enterprise data.

### 3. Advanced GenAI Capabilities

-   Prompt engineering techniques such as Few-shot and Chain-of-Thought
    to guide AI behavior.
-   Introduction to Bedrock Agents for automating multi-step workflows
    and executing API-based tasks.
-   Demonstration of Guardrails to ensure outputs remain safe and
    appropriate for end users.

## Key Takeaways

### Design Mindset

-   AI is now accessible to all developers; with Bedrock, advanced AI
    features can be integrated via simple APIs.
-   Contextual data is essential --- RAG enables AI systems to deliver
    business-specific, high-value responses.

### Technical Architecture

-   Managed services like Bedrock and SageMaker are more secure and
    cost-efficient than self-hosting models on EC2.
-   Safety frameworks must be embedded into any AI-driven product before
    reaching users.

### Practical Applications

-   Research RAG to build intelligent, data-aware search and chatbot
    features.
-   Strengthen knowledge around data protection and encryption (e.g.,
    KMS).
-   Ensure private data is not used to train public foundation models.

## Event Experience

-   The workshop simplified complex AI/ML concepts through clear
    explanations and hands-on examples.
-   The GenAI chatbot demo showed how fast real prototypes can be built.
-   Networking activities provided insights into the rising demand for
    developers familiar with AI tools and workflows.
