## Key Takeaways

- **Networking:** Mentors and peers in this program can become valuable long-term professional connections.

- **Soft Skills:** Clear communication and proper documentation are crucial for success in team environments.

## Applying to Work

- **Set a Clear Plan:** Establish a goal for the 4-month internship—achieve the **AWS Solutions Architect Associate** certificate and complete one end-to-end capstone project.
- **Build Your Portfolio:** Document weekly tasks, technical notes, and project milestones on GitHub or a personal blog (like this Hugo site).
- **Engage with Mentors:** Conduct bi-weekly review sessions with your assigned mentor to evaluate code quality and discuss architecture choices for the _Student Management System_ project.
